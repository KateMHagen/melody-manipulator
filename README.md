### Melody Manipulator  
A project I completed in my Data Structures and Program Design lab at CSU Northridge that focuses on queues and stacks.  

My task was to complete the class that represents a song, called MelodyQueue in the file MelodyQueue.java. I implemented several methods which allows you to use MelodyMain to play a song with mp3 player like functionality.  
Your melody will be able to play as well as append another melody to itself, reverse and have the tempo changed.

To run:  
Download the ZIP and open the files in your IDE. 

Run MelodyMain.java.     

The instructions will be printed in the console.

In the console, you first have to load a text file: `load` then input a txt file `birthday.txt` (or zombie.txt or twinkle.txt)  

If you are US based, use the text files:  
    `birthday-us.txt` or  
    `zombie-us.txt` or    
    `twinkle-us.txt`  

Turn on the volume of your device to hear the song and the following actions you do to it.

After loading a text file in the console, you can run one action at a time:  
    `load` : load a new input file  
    `save` : output to a file  
    `print` : prints the contents of the last loaded song  
    `play` : play the last loaded song  
    `reverse` : reverse the last loaded song  
    `duration` : print out the length of the last loaded song in seconds  
    `tempo` : change the speed by a percentage   
    `append` : appends notes from a second melody to the loaded one  
    `quit` : exit the program
