A Data Structures and Program Design lab project that focuses on queues and stacks. 

All the methods I created are added to MelodyQueue.java 
My task was to complete the class that represents a song, called MelodyQueue. I implemented several methods which allows you to use MelodyMain to play a song with mp3 player like functionality. Your melody will be able to play as well as append another melody to itself, reverse and have the tempo changed.

To run:
Open the files in your IDE. 

Run MelodyMain.java. 

In console first load a text file: `load birthday.txt` (or zombie.txt or twinkle.txt)

If you are US based, use the text files: 
    birthday-us.txt
    zombie-us.txt
    twinkle-us.txt

Turn on the volume of your device to hear the song and the following actions you do to it.
Then follow the instructions in the console to do the following: save, print, play, reverse, duration, tempo, append or quit.
