A Data Structures and Program Design lab project that focuses on queues and stacks. All the methods I created are added to MelodyQueue.java 
My task was to complete the class that represents a song, called MelodyQueue. I implemented several methods which allows you to use MelodyMain to play a song with mp3 player like functionality. Your melody will be able to play as well as append another melody to itself, reverse and have the tempo changed.
